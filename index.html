                <h2 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;font-size: 40px;color: #fdb944;">Tooth Decay Is Frightening, but a Dentist Can Fix It</h2>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">You only get one set of adult teeth, which makes it frightening to see signs of tooth decay. Here's what your dentist in Ashburn, VA can do for you.</h3>
                <center>
                <img style="height: 700px;width: 80%;" src="https://lirp.cdn-website.com/a167df83/dms3rep/multi/opt/simply-smiles-family-implant-dentistry-ashburn-va-tooth-decay-1920w.jpg" alt="Crawl Space Encapsulation"></center>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">More than 90 percent of adults in the U.S. have at least one cavity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, regular trips to the dentist in Ashburn, VA, can help fix those problems! Tooth decay can lead to tooth loss and significantly impact your oral hygiene. <br>
                <br>There are several things a dentist can do to fight tooth decay, including regular checkups. Moreover, filling cavities and root canals is an excellent preventative measure. <br>
                <br>Here's what a dentist in Ashburn, VA, can do for you and how they would treat tooth decay. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Regular Checkups</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">According to the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/home-care" style="color: #1a71b8;"><b>American Dental Association</a></b>, your dental treatment should include regular dental checkups every six months. A good relationship with your dentist will improve your oral hygiene, preventing future problems.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Dental Cleanings</h4>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">A dental hygienist will do a routine dental cleaning to remove tartar, plaque, and stains from your teeth. A hygienist will also use fluoride. <br>
                <br>They will also discuss your overall oral health, including if you have sharp pain or tooth sensitivity. <br>
                <br>Furthermore, the hygienist will report any problems and issues to the dentist. </p>
                <h4 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Mouth Cancer </h4>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Several things that can cause mouth cancer include tobacco and alcohol, and the human papillomavirus (HPV) virus. <br>
                <br><a href="https://www.simplysmilesdds.com/preventive-dentistry" style="color: #1a71b8;"><b>A regular checkup</a></b> will check for signs of mouth cancer. Your doctor will then recommend further dental treatment.</p>
                <h4 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">X-rays</h4>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">New patients get dental X-rays so the dentist can get a better look at the structure of their teeth. It also gives them a good indication of the bone structure of your jaw. <br>X-rays are necessary when you have a crown or fillings. The X-rays give the dentist a better picture of how the restorative work is holding up in your mouth. </p>
                <br>
                <h4 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Routines </h4>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">In addition, a dentist in Ashburn, VA, will discuss daily routines that will lead to your oral hygiene success. These steps include flossing, brushing, and avoiding foods that cause tooth decay, such as sugary foods. <br>
                <br>Don't be ashamed about not knowing how to care for your teeth. Your dental care provider is there to give you the best advice!
                <br>Check with your dental insurance company about help paying for these visits. In many cases, regular cleanings and checkups come with your insurance plan. </p>
                <br>
                <h3  style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Filling Cavities</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Tiny open holes in your teeth eventually form cavities. You get cavities from smoking, eating sugary foods, snacking, and failing to clean your teeth. <br>
                <br>Cavities grow and, ultimately, cause tooth decay. <br>
                <br>You may not know you have a cavity in your mouth until you have tooth sensitivity or sharp pain. <br>
                <br>First, the dentist will numb the nerves around the tooth. They will then clean the area around your tooth. In addition, they will use a drill to break through the tooth enamel and eliminate the tooth's damaged portion. <br>
                <br>Cavities range in size. Much depends on how long the cavity has been in your mouth and how long it's been left untreated. <br>
                <br>The dental treatment includes filling the tooth with resin to preserve it in your mouth. <br>
                <br>Easy ways to spot cavities in your mouth are black or brown spots. In addition, you might have pain and sensitivity to hot and cold. Essentially, it breaks down your tooth enamel. 
                <br >Untreated cavities can also lead to infections and eventual tooth loss. </p>
                <br>
                <h3  style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Root Canals</h3>
                <br>
                <p  style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Thanks to tooth decay, a large cavity or cracked tooth can lead to a root canal. The large roots in your teeth are full of nerves, which can cause much pain when there's a crack. <br>
                <br>You might also have swollen gums or an abscess. These are both signs you'll need a root canal. <br>
                <br>The dentist will start by numbing your jaw, then breaking open the top of the tooth and accessing the roots. The process involves removing the infected pulp and nerve in the tooth. <br>
                <br>To finish the root canal, the dentist will fill the tooth's roots and then seal the tooth. <br>
                <br>Once it sets, you must get a porcelain crown on top; your tooth is as good as new! Most root canals are completed in one to two appointments. <br>
                <br>After a root canal, you might want to stick to soft foods for a few days. Your dentist might also prescribe some medication to prevent an infection. </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Tooth Extraction</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">A damaged tooth that is cracked or can't be saved might have to be removed. <br>
                <br>Pulling a tooth can be painful. Your dentist will numb the area and remove the tooth from your jaw. Sometimes, an oral surgeon might put you to sleep before removing the tooth. <br> 
                <br>After removal, you will need time to heal. You must keep the area clean with a mouthwash. Your doctor will also likely prescribe medication for pain and infection. <br>
                <br>It will take a few days to return to normal - eating solid foods might be tricky. </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Dental Implant</h3>
                <br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">Your dentist will likely install a dental implant to replace the area left absent by a missing tooth. <br>
                <br>First, the doctor will do a bone graft to determine if there's enough jawbone to hold the new, 'fake' tooth. <br>
                <br>The dentist will then drill a metal post into your bone. Upon healing, you will then receive a porcelain crown. The crown will match the other teeth in your mouth. <br>
                <br>You must visit the dentist for regular cleanings once you receive a dental implant. An implant can last a long period of time when properly cared for. </p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 10%;">What a Dentist in Ashburn, VA, Can Do About Tooth Decay</h3>
